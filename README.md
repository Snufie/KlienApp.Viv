# KlienApp
This is the GitHub repository for the (currently) web-based application for **Klien®** proffessional cleaning company based in The Netherlands. This is a fresh take on a scheduling application for our employees. Due to a mistake on our end, by hiring inexperienced developers, causing the Native Based app to be buggy and chaotic; a mess. Luckily we called in the aid of **Snufie** and their team of developers to develop a simple but slick new web-based application that would be user-friendly, sophisticated and overseeable whilst keeping that refined modern look we all love.

## A word from Snufie
This project was a big thing when the people at Klien® came up to me asking if I could build a user-friendly WebApp for them. It was also a little personal as a family member works there and I have often heard various employees and even staff members complain about their mobile app not working, glitching out or straight up crashing. My team and I could do way better, it would take a bunch of time though. We warned them of this but they said it was fine.

So we started working on ideas and concepts. We got a bunch now that we'd like to share in a sort of 'roadmap':

- [ ] Calendar of an entire month, each day segmented into 24 hours, with plannable events.
- [ ] Scheduled work hours can easily be confirmed with the press of a button.
- [ ] The confirmation menu will give two(2) options: altering hours spent on said event or confirm as planned.
- [ ] Calling in sick per day is easy and just requires a few clicks, reporting back healthy is easy too.
- [ ] Coordinators can easily view client supply orders fast and efficiently with the new Orders tab.
- [ ] Employees can place supply orders for their regular clients once a month (or shorter/longer depending on the type of supply needed, toiletpaper rolls can be ordered once a month whilst cleaning product can be ordered once every 2 months).
- [ ] Coordinators can check off completed orders which will notify the employee who placed the order via email.
- [ ] Each employee can view their profile with their holiday hours, spendable days-off and their average hours worked per day, week and month.
- [ ] Each scheduled event will show if an employee is working on their own or not and, by clicking on the event, who they are working with.
- [ ] Complaints from clients will appear in the Complaints & Requests tab, this will show complaints given by clients and requests for special cleaning services requested by clients.
- [ ] TBA

Why should our schedule be any different?
